camwatch was originally written by Chris Black <no known email address>.

R Pickett <emerson@hayseed.net>, a regular user of camwatch, discovered
that Chris had disappeared off the net, to all appearances, and took it
upon himself to maintain it, starting with version 0.1 in Jan 2002.

camwatch contains motion-detection code cheerfully lifted from motion
2.6.3 by Jeroen Vreeken <pe1rxq@amsat.org>.
