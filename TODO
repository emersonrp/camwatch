-- Verify image downloaded completely, if not, reload immediately.

-- Add in .camwatch conf file so we don't need all these command-line
  switches just to get it to work.

-- Possibly roll out imlib in favor of something less-full-featured but
  more well-written.  Not imlib2.

-- Incorporate motion-detection into archiving routine so we don't
  fill up our hard drives with hundreds of copies of the same
  image.

-- Pondering moving to SDL so as to make camwatch portable to Windows
  since imlib and libcurl are already there.

-- Probably more things.
